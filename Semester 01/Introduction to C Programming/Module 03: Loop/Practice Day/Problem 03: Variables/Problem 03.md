Problem Statement

You've learned about variables, right? Now it's time to practice them. You need to take an integer A, a very big integer B, a floating value C, and a character D as input and output them serially.

Input Format
- First line will contain A
- Second line will contain B
- The third line will contain C
- Fourth line will contain D

Constraints
1. -10^9 <= A <= 10^9
2. -10^18 <= B <= 10^18
3. -10^9 <= C <= 10^9

Output Format
- Output them serially and put a new line after each value. Output the floating value 2 points after the decimal.
