Note: X may be found once or more than once and may not be found.

Input
First line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105) number of elements.

Second line contains N numbers (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109).

Third line contains a number X (0 ≤ X ≤ 109).

Output
Print the position of X in the first time you find it. If it doesn't exist print -1.
